I started this project to get better at Material UI, and React overall. I specifically chose Anilist because it's site is very smooth, and easy to navigate with really good infographics. On top of that, it provided GraphQL API that made it easy to query whatever I need easily.

This project was stalled because I was getting busy with my exams and I never picked it up again.
