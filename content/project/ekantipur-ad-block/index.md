This is one of a handy userscript I made public because it might come handy to others as well. I only limited the script to Ekantipur because that's what I frequent the most.

I was planning to read on adblock bit more and make a better tool to block ads but then I found someone was maintaining an adblock filter for various popular Nepali sites including Ekantipur: https://github.com/sndsabin/swaccha-adblock-filter. It's safe to say that this project won't be continued.
